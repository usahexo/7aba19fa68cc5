If you’ve won or lost money gambling in 2018, you’ll need to report that information when you file your taxes this year.</p>
<p>Fortunately, reporting gambling winnings and losses is fairly straightforward. Here’s what you need to know:</p>
<p>Reporting Gambling Winnings</p>
<p>If you have winnings from any kind of gambling activity, you’ll need to report those winnings on line 21 of your 1040 tax form. This includes winnings from casino games, horse racing, lotteries, and other types of gambling.</p>
<p>In order to report your gambling winnings accurately, you’ll need to know the amount of your winnings in U.S. dollars. You don’t need to report the value of any prizes or gifts you may have received as part of your gambling activity; only the amount of money you actually won is taxable.</p>
<p>If you have multiple sources of gambling income, be sure to combine them all on one line on your tax form. For example, if you won $1,000 from casino games and $100 from a racetrack betting parlor, your total gambling income would be $1,100.</p>
<p>Reporting Gambling Losses</p>
<p>If you had gambling losses during the year, you can deduct those losses on line 28 of your 1040 tax form. In order to claim these losses, however, you first need to itemize your deductions; if you take the standard deduction instead, you can’t claim any gambling losses.</p>
<p>The amount of your allowable gambling losses is limited to the amount of your reported gambling income for the year. So if your total taxable gambling income for the year was $1,000, for example, your total allowable losses would be $1,000 as well. If you had $2,000 in gambling losses but only $1,000 in gambling income for the year, you could only claim $1,000 worth of losses on your tax return.</p>
<p>Keep careful records of both your wins and losses throughout the year; it’s important to have documentation in case the IRS ever questions your claims. You should also keep track of how much money you spent on gambling-related expenses such as travel expenses and lost wagers.</p>
<h1 id="Do-You-Have-to-Report-Gambling-Winnings-and-Losses"><a href="#Do-You-Have-to-Report-Gambling-Winnings-and-Losses" class="headerlink" title="Do You Have to Report Gambling Winnings and Losses?"></a>Do You Have to Report Gambling Winnings and Losses?</h1><p>When gambling, you may be wondering if you are required to report your winnings and losses to the IRS. The answer is: it depends. </p>
<p>Generally, you must report gambling winnings as income on your tax return. This includes winnings from lotteries, raffles, horse races, and casinos. However, there are a few exceptions. For example, you do not need to report winnings from social games played with friends or amounts won from games of skill, such as poker or blackjack. </p>
<p>You must also report gambling losses on your tax return. However, you can only deduct losses up to the amount of your gambling winnings. So, if you had $1,000 in gambling winnings and $2,000 in gambling losses, you can only deduct $1,000 of your losses on your tax return. </p>
<p>If you have questions about whether or not you need to report your gambling income and losses, be sure to speak with a tax professional.</p>

The type of gambling, the amount of winnings and losses, and your filing status all affect how you report your gambling income and expenses on your tax return.</p>
<p>Here are the basics:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Gambling income is taxable. You must report all of your gambling income on your tax return, even if you don’t receive a Form W-2G.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Gambling losses are deductible. You can deduct your gambling losses on Schedule A (Form 1040), but only up to the extent of your gambling income.</p>
</li>
<li><p>You must keep track of both your winnings and losses separately. It’s important to keep good records of your gambling activity so that you can accurately report it on your tax return. This includes records of: -The date and amount of each wager -The name of the casino, race track, etc. where you placed each wager -The payouts (winnings) or losses for each wager</p>
</li>
</ul>

Here’s how to report them on your return:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Report all gambling winnings - Whether you hit it big at the casino or won a small bet with your friends, report all of your gambling income. This includes cash, goods and services, and the fair market value of any prize or award you won.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Report all gambling losses - Likewise, report all of your gambling losses. This includes any money you lost as well as the cost of any related expenses, such as travel to and from the casino or tickets to the game.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Net gambling winnings - Once you’ve reported both your winnings and losses, subtract your losses from your winnings to calculate your net gambling winnings. This is the amount you’ll include on your tax return.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Use Schedule C or C-EZ - Gambling income and losses are reported on Schedule C or C-EZ, which is used to report business income and expenses. If you only have gambling income, use Schedule C-EZ; if you have both gambling income and losses, use Schedule C.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Claim allowable deductions - In addition to reporting your net gambling winnings, you may also be able to claim allowable deductions related to your gambling activity. These can include transportation costs, meals and lodging while gambling, and other associated expenses. Be sure to check with the IRS to see what deductions are available to you.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Tax time can be daunting, but if you have gambling income or losses it doesn’t have to be complicated. Just follow these simple steps and you’ll be ready to go!</p>
