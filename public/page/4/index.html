        <h1 id="What-is-the-Fish-Market"><a href="#What-is-the-Fish-Market" class="headerlink" title="What is the Fish Market?"></a>What is the Fish Market?</h1><p>The Fish Market is a wholesale market in the heart of San Francisco, California. It is one of the largest markets of its kind on the West Coast of the United States. The market has been open since 1851 and moved to its current location on the Embarcadero in 1941. The market is open from 4am until 9pm Monday through Saturday, and from 4am until 7pm on Sundays.</p>
<p>The Fish Market is a major center for the trade of seafood in the western United States. The market consists of more than 100 vendors who sell fresh fish, shellfish, and other seafood items. The most popular items at the market include salmon, tuna, shrimp, and crab. The Fish Market also has a wide variety of other seafood items, including squid, octopus, eel, and lobster.</p>
<p>The Fish Market is a major tourist attraction in San Francisco. More than 1 million people visit the market each year. The market is busiest on Saturdays when more than 25,000 people visit it. The market has also been featured in several movies and television shows, including Pier 39 and Tales From the Crypt.</p>
<h1 id="What-is-the-Seafood-Market-Graham-Greene-2022"><a href="#What-is-the-Seafood-Market-Graham-Greene-2022" class="headerlink" title="What is the Seafood Market Graham Greene 2022?"></a>What is the Seafood Market Graham Greene 2022?</h1><p>The Seafood Market Graham Greene 2022 is a proposed complex in the heart of Miami that would combine retail, wholesale, and restaurant components all focused on seafood. The developers, real estate firm AECOM, Miami-Dade County, and Nelson Byrd Woltz Landscape Architects (NBW), are proposing the market to fill a void in Miami’s food landscape.</p>
<p>The market would occupy 16 acres and include six acres of water filled with salt water fish, crustaceans, and mollusks; two acres of greenhouses growing native fruits and vegetables; a demonstration kitchen and education center; a dock providing direct access to fishermen; and a 100-seat seafood restaurant. The market would also have a “local heroes” program that would give preference to local fisherman, farmers, chefs, and artisans.</p>
<p>One goal of the project is to promote sustainable fishing practices. The designers hope that the market will help to reverse the decline of marine life in the area. They are working with NOAA Fisheries Service to develop aquaculture programs that will create a closed loop system for recycling nutrients and water.</p>
<p>The Seafood Market Graham Greene 2022 is still in the planning stages, but if it is approved it could open as early as 2020.</p>
