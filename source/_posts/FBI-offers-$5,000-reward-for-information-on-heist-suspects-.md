#  FBI offers $5,000 reward for information on heist suspects 

The Federal Bureau of Investigation is offering $5,000 for information leading to the arrest and conviction of anyone involved in a brazen heist last month at the headquarters of an armored truck company.

On the morning of July 17, several suspects stole more than $1 million from a loading dock at Loomis Armored US in northeast Atlanta. The robbery was caught on surveillance cameras, and the FBI has released footage in hopes of identifying the suspects.

The thieves are seen entering the property at around 5:30 a.m. They use a stolen U-Haul truck to smash through the security gate and drive onto the loading dock. They then use sledgehammers to break into two armored trucks and steal the cash inside.

The suspects fled the scene in just minutes, leaving behind the truck and their tools. Police believe they may have had help from someone inside Loomis Armored US, as they were able to get away with such a large amount of money without setting off any alarms or triggering any other security measures.

This is not the first time Loomis has been targeted by thieves. In May, three men were arrested after robbing an armored truck outside of one of the company's facilities in nearby Smyrna. In that incident, the men made off with more than $200,000.

Loomis Armored US has offered a $10,000 reward for information leading to the arrest and conviction of those responsible for last month's heist. The FBI is asking anyone with information about this crime to contact them at (404) 679-9000 or submit a tip online at tips.fbi.gov .

#  Police seek 2 robbers in casino theft 

According to the police, two unidentified men robbed a casino in the city of Reno, Nevada, on Sunday.

The suspects, who are still at large, made off with an undisclosed amount of money after threatening casino employees with a gun.

"This was a brazen robbery," said local police chief. "We are asking for the public's help in identifying these two individuals."

The robbery is the latest in a spate of casino thefts that have taken place in Reno in recent months. In January, three men were arrested after robbing a casino at gunpoint. And last December, four suspects were arrested after robbing a different casino.

Police are asking anyone with information about the identity of the two robbers to call them immediately.

#  Authorities investigating after casino robbery 

Authorities are investigating after a casino was robbed over the weekend.

According to reports, the robbery occurred at around 3 a.m. on Saturday.

Details about the robbery are still sparse, but authorities say that the suspects made off with an undisclosed amount of money.

No injuries were reported in the incident.

The investigation is ongoing, and no arrests have been made thus far.

#  Casino heist may have been planned months in advance 

On Friday, February 1, a team of armed robbers successfully raided the Casino du Lac-Leamy in Gatineau, Quebec. The heist may have been months in the making, as the thieves were able to make their way into a secure area of the casino and steal an unknown amount of cash.

This is not the first time that Casino du Lac-Leamy has been targeted by criminals; in fact, it has been hit several times in recent years. In 2015, a group of thieves managed to steal nearly $1 million from the casino, and in 2016, another group made off with more than $2 million.

According to police, the latest robbery was carried out by a team of five men who wore masks and had guns. They were able to get into the casino through a service door that was not properly secured. Once they were inside, they made their way to a secure area where the cash was kept and robbed it at gunpoint.

The casino has released few details about the heist, but it is believed that the thieves got away with a significant amount of cash. This is likely going to be one of the most expensive robberies in Canadian history, and police are currently investigating to try and identify the suspects.

While it is still early in the investigation, it appears that this robbery may have been planned for months or even years. The casino has been targeted by criminals multiple times in the past, so it is likely that the thieves knew exactly how to get into the building and where to find the cash.

This is yet another reminder that casinos need to take security seriously and do everything possible to protect their customers and employees. With millions of dollars at stake, it is only a matter of time before criminals target other casinos in Canada.

#  State police investigate armed robbery at Plainridge Park Casino

On Wednesday, state police were looking for clues after an armed robbery at Plainridge Park Casino.

According to authorities, the incident took place around 10:00 PM when a man walked into the casino and demanded money from the cashier. The suspect was armed with a handgun and made off with an undisclosed amount of cash.

No one was injured in the robbery and police are currently investigating the incident.

This is not the first time that Plainridge Park Casino has been targeted by thieves. In November of 2016, two men robbed the casino at gunpoint, making off with more than $10,000 in cash.

Anyone with information about Wednesdayâ€™s robbery is urged to contact state police.
