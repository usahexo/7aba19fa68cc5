#  How to Report Gambling Winnings and Losses on Your 1040

When you gamble, whether it’s at the casino, the track, or even in a private game with friends, you may occasionally come out ahead—or behind. If you’ve won or lost money gambling in 2018, you’ll need to report that information when you file your taxes this year.

Fortunately, reporting gambling winnings and losses is fairly straightforward. Here’s what you need to know:

Reporting Gambling Winnings

If you have winnings from any kind of gambling activity, you’ll need to report those winnings on line 21 of your 1040 tax form. This includes winnings from casino games, horse racing, lotteries, and other types of gambling.

In order to report your gambling winnings accurately, you’ll need to know the amount of your winnings in U.S. dollars. You don’t need to report the value of any prizes or gifts you may have received as part of your gambling activity; only the amount of money you actually won is taxable.

If you have multiple sources of gambling income, be sure to combine them all on one line on your tax form. For example, if you won $1,000 from casino games and $100 from a racetrack betting parlor, your total gambling income would be $1,100.

Reporting Gambling Losses

If you had gambling losses during the year, you can deduct those losses on line 28 of your 1040 tax form. In order to claim these losses, however, you first need to itemize your deductions; if you take the standard deduction instead, you can't claim any gambling losses.

The amount of your allowable gambling losses is limited to the amount of your reported gambling income for the year. So if your total taxable gambling income for the year was $1,000, for example, your total allowable losses would be $1,000 as well. If you had $2,000 in gambling losses but only $1,000 in gambling income for the year, you could only claim $1,000 worth of losses on your tax return.

Keep careful records of both your wins and losses throughout the year; it’s important to have documentation in case the IRS ever questions your claims. You should also keep track of how much money you spent on gambling-related expenses such as travel expenses and lost wagers.

#  Do You Have to Report Gambling Winnings and Losses?

When gambling, you may be wondering if you are required to report your winnings and losses to the IRS. The answer is: it depends. 

Generally, you must report gambling winnings as income on your tax return. This includes winnings from lotteries, raffles, horse races, and casinos. However, there are a few exceptions. For example, you do not need to report winnings from social games played with friends or amounts won from games of skill, such as poker or blackjack. 

You must also report gambling losses on your tax return. However, you can only deduct losses up to the amount of your gambling winnings. So, if you had $1,000 in gambling winnings and $2,000 in gambling losses, you can only deduct $1,000 of your losses on your tax return. 

If you have questions about whether or not you need to report your gambling income and losses, be sure to speak with a tax professional.
