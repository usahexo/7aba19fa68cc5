#  DraftKings Rolling Out Casino Games Nationwide!

DraftKings announced that they will begin rolling out casino games nationwide. The popular fantasy sports site has been licensed in New Jersey to offer both online and live casino games.

DraftKings Casino will feature slots, table games, and a live dealer experience. The online casino will offer games from different providers, including IGT, NetEnt, and PokerStars.

The company plans to offer a variety of promotions to its customers, including free spins and deposit bonuses. In addition, players who bet on casino games will be able to earn rewards points that can be used for discounts on DraftKings merchandise or entries into paid contests.

The launch of the new casino offering comes as DraftKings ramps up its efforts to diversify its business. The company has faced increasing competition in the daily fantasy sports market, and it is hoped that the new casino games will attract new customers.

In addition to the United States, DraftKings has also launched its casino product in the United Kingdom.

#  Is DraftKings About To Take Over The Gambling Industry?

DraftKings is aBoston-based company that has been around since 2012. The company specializes in daily fantasy sports, a type of online gambling where players create teams of real-life athletes and compete against others for cash prizes.

The company has recently made headlines with their plans to expand into the world of traditional sports betting. This would make them the first major daily fantasy Sports company to move into the gambling market.

So why is this such a big deal?

Well, for starters, the global gambling market is worth an estimated $385 billion. And with online gambling growing at a rate of 10% per year, it's safe to say that DraftKings is eyeing up a pretty big piece of the pie.

But it's not just the size of the market that makes this such an attractive proposition for DraftKings; it's also the regulatory environment. In most jurisdictions, online gambling is tightly regulated and operators are required to have a license from the government. But in the United States, things are a little different.

The Unlawful Internet Gambling Enforcement Act of 2006 (UIGEA) made it illegal for banks and financial institutions to process transactions related to online gambling. This caused a lot of problems for the industry, as it became very difficult for players to deposit and withdraw money.

But things started to change in 2011 when New Jersey became the first state to legalize online gambling. This was followed by Delaware in 2012, Nevada in 2013 and Pennsylvania in 2017. As more and more states legalized online gambling, DraftKings saw an opportunity to get a piece of the pie.

And now with traditional sports betting set to become legal in many more states, DraftKings is well positioned to be a major player in the industry. So far, they have already applied for licenses in Nevada, New Jersey and West Virginia, and they are expected to apply for licenses in additional states over the coming months.

Of course, there are some risks associated with moving into the world of traditional sports betting. The biggest risk is that DraftKings may not be able to replicate their success inDaily Fantasy Sports (DFS). DFS is a much simpler product than traditional sports betting, so it may be difficult for them to compete against established operators like Caesar's Entertainment and William Hill Plc..

Nevertheless, DraftKings has shown that they are capable of innovate and take on established players in new markets. So if you're looking for a company with potential growth prospects, then DraftKings should definitely be on your radar
