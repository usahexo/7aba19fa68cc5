# How to play roulette

To play roulette, first choose your bet size. There are many different types of bets you can make, but we'll go over the most common ones. You can place a bet on a single number (called a "straight up bet"), on two numbers (called a "split bet"), on three numbers (called a "street bet"), or on four numbers (a "square" or "corner" bet).

After you've chosen your bet size, place your chips on the betting table on the corresponding number(s). The dealer will then spin the wheel and release the ball. The ball will eventually land in one of the numbered slots on the wheel, and if your number matches the number the ball lands in, you'll win!

#  How does Cloudbet roulette work?

Cloudbet roulette is a web-based casino game that allows players to bet on the results of a spinning wheel. Roulette is one of the most popular casino games in the world, and Cloudbet’s roulette offering is one of the most popular games on its site.

In Cloudbet roulette, players can bet on red or black, odd or even, or a number from 1 to 36. They can also bet on whether the ball will fall into a particular slot on the wheel. The payout for each type of bet varies, but Cloudbet offers some of the best odds in the industry.

The wheel has 37 slots, numbered 0-36. There are 18 red slots and 18 black slots, and each slot is coloured either red or black. There are also two green slots – one marked “0” and one marked “00”. When you place a bet, you’re betting on which colour the ball will land in, or whether it will be odd or even. You can also bet on which number the ball will land in (1-36), or whether it will fall into one of the two green slots.

If you bet on a colour (red or black), then you win if the ball lands in a corresponding slot on the wheel. If you bet on odd or even, then you win if the number showing when the ball comes to rest is odd or even, respectively. If you bet on a particular number (1-36), then you win if the ball lands in that slot on the wheel. Finally, if you bet on one of the green slots (0 or 00), then you win if the ball falls into that slot.

There are different types of bets that can be placed in Cloudbet roulette: inside bets and outside bets. An inside bet is when you place your wager on a particular number (1-36) or one of the green slots (0 or 00). An outside bet is when you place your wager on red or black, odd or even, 1-18 or 19-36.

When you make your first deposit at Cloudbet, you receive a 100% welcome bonus up to 5 bitcoins. This means that if you deposit 5 bitcoins, you’ll get 10 bitcoins to play with – giving you ample opportunity to try out all of our fantastic casino games!
