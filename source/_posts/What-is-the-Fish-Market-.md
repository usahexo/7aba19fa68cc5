#  What is the Seafood Market Graham Greene 2022? 

The Seafood Market Graham Greene 2022 is a proposed complex in the heart of Miami that would combine retail, wholesale, and restaurant components all focused on seafood. The developers, real estate firm AECOM, Miami-Dade County, and Nelson Byrd Woltz Landscape Architects (NBW), are proposing the market to fill a void in Miami's food landscape.

The market would occupy 16 acres and include six acres of water filled with salt water fish, crustaceans, and mollusks; two acres of greenhouses growing native fruits and vegetables; a demonstration kitchen and education center; a dock providing direct access to fishermen; and a 100-seat seafood restaurant. The market would also have a "local heroes" program that would give preference to local fisherman, farmers, chefs, and artisans.

One goal of the project is to promote sustainable fishing practices. The designers hope that the market will help to reverse the decline of marine life in the area. They are working with NOAA Fisheries Service to develop aquaculture programs that will create a closed loop system for recycling nutrients and water.

The Seafood Market Graham Greene 2022 is still in the planning stages, but if it is approved it could open as early as 2020.
