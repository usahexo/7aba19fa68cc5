#  How to Win at the Expert Roulette Endwalker in Final Fantasy 14 

Endwalker is one of the many end game strategies that can be employed in Final Fantasy 14. It is a bit more complex than some of the others, so it will take a while to learn, but it can be a very powerful tool if used correctly.

The basic premise of Endwalker is to use the two most powerfulヽEndgame Moves≫ in the game; 《Miasma Blade》 and 《Doom Spike》. Miasma Blade is a move that does damage over time, and Doom Spike is a move that does heavy damage and also has a chance to instantly kill the enemy. The goal is to use these two moves back-to-back as often as possible to overwhelm the enemy and take them down as quickly as possible.

There are two main ways to use Endwalker; burst strategy or sustained damage strategy. The burst strategy involves using the two moves back-to-back very quickly, while the sustained damage strategy involves using them more slowly over time to do gradual damage. Both strategies have their own benefits and drawbacks, so it is up to the player to decide which one works best for them.

The burst strategy is faster but requires more precision, while the sustained damage strategy is slower but more reliable. The burst strategy also has the potential to do much more damage, while the sustained damage strategy can be used for longer fights without running out of MP. Ultimately, it is up to the player to decide which strategy works best for them.
