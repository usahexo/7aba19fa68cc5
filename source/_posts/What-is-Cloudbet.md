#  What is RasenBallsport Leipzig?

RasenBallsport Leipzig, simply known as Leipzig is a professional football club based in the city of Leipzig, Saxony, Germany. The club was formed in 2009 following the merger of two predecessor clubs, VfL 05 Leipzig and RasenBallsport Sachsen Leipzig. The club achieved promotion to the Bundesliga for the first time in its history in 2016.

Leipzig is owned by Red Bull GmbH, a company which manufactures energy drinks and other products. The club's home stadium is the Red Bull Arena, which has a capacity of 44,300 spectators. The club's name was changed from RasenBallsport Leipzig to RB Leipzig in 2016, following protests from supporters against the ownership of the club by Red Bull GmbH.

# History of RB Leipzig

The club was formed on 19 May 2009 following the merger of VfL 05 Leipzig and RasenBallsport Sachsen Leipzig. Both predecessor clubs had their roots in football clubs that were founded in 1905. VfL 05 Leipzig played in the tier-four Oberliga Nordost while RasenBallsport Sachsen Leipzig played in the tier-five Regionalliga Nordost.

The new club took on the name RasenBallsport Leipzig and finished runners-up in their debut season in the Oberliga Nordost, scoring 101 goals in 34 games. The club then went on to win back-to-back promotions, moving up to the 3. Liga for the 2011–12 season and then to 2. Bundesliga for the 2012–13 season. RB Leipzig finished 4th place in their first 2. Bundesliga season with 61 points from 34 games. This saw them qualify for promotion play-offs where they lost to FC Ingolstadt 04 5–4 on aggregate after being 3–1 up after the first leg of the semi-final tie.

In November 2013, Red Bull GmbH became majority shareholder of RasenBallsport Leipzig by purchasing a majority stake from brothers Dietrich Mateschitz and Robert Louis-Dreyfus. This led to protests from supporters of both clubs against Red Bull GmbH's controversial ownership of RBLeizpig with some supporters setting fire to effigies of Dietrich Mateschitz outside the stadium. In response to these protests, RBLeizpig changed their name from RasenBallsportLeizpig to RBLeizpigin June 2016.

In their second 2 Bundesligasaison, RBLeizpig finished 5th place with 63 points from 34 games and qualified for Europa League qualification play-offs where they were drawn against Austrian side FC Salzburg who they defeated 5–3 on aggregate over two legs thanks largely to a hat trick from Timo Werner over both legs.. This saw them enter into this year's edition of Europa League where they reached group stage before being knocked out by Besiktas JK 6 points behind Turkish side Beşiktaş who topped group E with 14 points

#  How do I RasenBallsport Leipzig?

In 1991, a group of friends in the eastern German city of Leipzig got together to form a football club. The team drew its name from the RasenBallsport Leipzig, or "Leipzig BallSport", company that provided their playing fields. The company was formed a year earlier by Dr. jur. Reinhard Mateschitz, an Austrian entrepreneur and Red Bull employee.

Red Bull had been trying to break into the German market since 1988 but had failed due to resistance from existing clubs and fans. In 2001, Mateschitz bought SV Austria Salzburg and rebranded them as Red Bull Salzburg. The new club played in red and white, the colours of Red Bull, and were promoted to the Austrian Bundesliga in 2003.

Red Bull's successful rebranding of Salzburg caught the attention of Thomas Röttgermann, one of the founders of RasenBallsport Leipzig. He approached Mateschitz with the idea of starting a new football club in Leipzig that would be affiliated with Red Bull. Mateschitz agreed and gave Röttgermann exclusive rights to use the name "RasenBallsport Leipzig" for five years.

RasenBallsport Leipzig was founded on 2 June 2009 and began playing in the fifth-division Verbandsliga Sachsen (Saxony Football Association). They won their division in 2012 and were promoted to the NOFV-Oberliga Süd (South Eastern Football Association). RB Leipzig won back-to-back championships in 2014 and 2015 and were promoted to 3. Liga (Third Division). They were promoted to 2. Bundesliga at the end of the 2015–16 season after finishing second in their division.

RB Leipzig made headlines in their first season in 2. Bundesliga by becoming the first team ever to earn promotion after finishing last in their division the previous season. They achieved this by winning seven out of their last nine matches, including a 1–0 victory over former champions FC Ingolstadt 04 on the final day of the season. RB finished fourth in their inaugural 2. Bundesliga season, narrowly missing out on promotion to Hoffenheim due for goal difference.[1]

RB Leipzig will begin their 2017-18 campaign in Germany's top flight football league, Bundesliga, after being promoted at the end of their 2016-17 campaign where they finished second in 2 .Bundesliga .The Bulls have caused some commotion amongst other teams within Germany since promotion as they are backed by energy drink giants Red Bull ,the same company who own sister club RB Salzburg across Europe . This has caused mixed reactions with some accusing RB Leipzig of buying success whilst others credit them for giving hope to clubs outside of Germany's top 6 finance wise . Either way , this will be an interesting season for RB as they look establish themselves as a permanent fixture within Bundesliga ,and maybe even compete for European honours further down the line .
