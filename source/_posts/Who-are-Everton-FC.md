#  What is Everton FC's history?

 Everton Football Club is an English professional football club based in Liverpool. The club was formed in 1878 and joined the Football League in 1888. Everton have won the league championship five times and the FA Cup twice.

The club's home ground is Goodison Park, which opened in 1892 and is the oldest purpose-built football stadium in England still in use. The club's most recent major trophy was the 1995 FA Cup.

Everton were founded as St Domingo's in 1878 by the Reverend William Barclay Scougal and the Rev. Walter Dunlop. The club played its first competitive match in November 1878, a 1–0 victory over Everton Church Club. In 1882, St Domingo's became Everton Football Club. The club's first success came in 1884 when they won the Lancashire Cup.

In 1888, Everton joined The Football League when it was founded and won their first League Championship two seasons later. Everton also won the FA Cup for the first time that year, beating Bolton Wanderers 1–0 in the final at Crystal Palace. However, after finishing fourth on three occasions between 1894 and 1896, they then finished bottom of the table for three consecutive seasons from 1897 to 1899, including a season where they only mustered 3 points from 22 games (the lowest ever points tally in top-flight English football).

It was not until 1905 that Everton regained their place in Division One, finishing runner-up to Newcastle United. They would go on to win successive league titles in 1911 and 1912 under manager Harry Makepeace, before reaching their first FA Cup Final in 1914. However, they lost 3–1 to Manchester City at Crystal Palace, with goals from Sandy Young (2) and Billy Meredith (1). 
In 1920/21 Everton finished runners-up to Wolves but narrowly avoided relegation due to their superior goal average over Chelsea (despite having a worse record than Chelsea over 46 matches played), who were relegated on goal average despite winning more games over the season than Everton did (20 against 19). 
Between 1923 and 1938 Everton were managed by Howard Kendall – one of only three managers to have led the club to major trophies – who guided them to league titles in 1933 and 1935 as well as FA Cups wins back-to-back in 1934 and 1936; his last trophy as manager was also European success as they lifted the 1968 European Cup Winners' Cup after a two-legged victory against Benfica (3–1 on aggregate). After relegation from Division Two at the end of the 1961/62 season under manager Johnny Carey, Kendall returned for a second spell as manager between 1981 and 1987 which yielded two title successes (in 1984 and 1986) as well as an FA Cup win in 1984; this made him one of only six managers ever to win major trophies with both Liverpool clubs (the others being Matt Busby, Bob Paisley, Kenny Dalglish, Joe Fagan & Rafael Benitez). 

After several years of financial struggle which saw them fall into Division Three halfway through Ronald Koeman’s first season as manager following his appointment in June 2016 with the team sat just above relegation zone after 8 games played - [1][2] - they finished 7th following an impressive end of season run which saw them lose just 2 out of their last 12 games - [3][4] - . On 3 May 2017 it was announced that Farhad Moshiri had become controlling shareholder of Everton FC with 50% ownership of shares transferring from former owner Robert Earl .[5]

#  What kit do Everton FC wear?

Everton have had a number of different kits over the years, with some more memorable than others. The current kit is blue and white, with a blue shirt and white shorts.

The first Everton kit was all white, and was introduced in 1878. This kit was used until 1884, when Everton changed to blue and white striped shirts. This kit was used until 1887, when Everton changed to blue shirts and white shorts. This kit has been used ever since, with the exception of the 1993-94 season, when Everton changed to all black.

The iconic blue and white stripes were initially inspired by John Houlding's former club Liverpool FC, who played in blue and white striped shirts. However, Everton's stripes are much thicker than Liverpool's stripes, which give them a very distinctive look.

Everton's current kit is manufactured by Umbro and was first worn during the 2016-17 season. The shirt features a modern v-neck style collar, with white trim on the sides of the collar. The shirt also features blue piping down the sides of the shirt and around the cuffs. The shorts are white with blue trim on the sides and around the waistband. The socks are also blue with white trim at the top.

Everton's kits have been worn by some of the club's greatest players over the years, including Dixie Dean, Duncan Ferguson and Wayne Rooney.
