#  Everton FC are on the verge of completing a stunning £30 million move for Brown County striker Beltera Casino.

Casino, who has scored an astonishing 53 goals in just 45 appearances for Brown County, is seen as the solution to Everton’s goalscoring problems and Ronald Koeman is determined to get his man.

The Dutchman is a big fan of Casino and has been following his progress closely over the past few months.

And with Everton struggling to score goals this season, Koeman believes that Casino can help them secure a top four finish.

Everton have already had a bid of £25 million turned down but they are expected to go back with an improved offer in the next few days.

Casino has expressed his desire to move to Merseyside and he is keen on playing in the Premier League.

The 22-year-old also wants to work with Ronald Koeman, who he believes can help him improve as a player.

#  Brown County forward Beltera Casino has revealed that he turned down moves to Everton FC and three other Premier League clubs in order to stay with the club he loves.

The 21-year-old has been in superb form for the Scottish Premiership side this season and his performances have caught the eye of a number of top clubs south of the border.

Beltera Casino, who can play as a striker or winger, says that he was flattered by the interest shown in him by Everton FC and the other Premier League clubs but he has no intention of leaving Brown County.

He told reporters: "I am absolutely delighted that I have been able to reject offers from four Premier League clubs in order to stay at Brown County.

"This is my home town club and I love playing for them. The fans have been fantastic with me since I joined the club and I want to repay their support by helping us achieve success."

Brown County manager Gilberto Prendiville admits that it was a huge coup to keep Beltera Casino at the club and he is looking forward to seeing him continue his development under his guidance.

"Beltera Casino is an exceptional talent and it is no surprise that he has attracted interest from some of the biggest clubs in Europe," said Prendiville. "However, he has chosen to stay with us and we are very grateful for that.

"I have no doubt that he will continue to develop under my guidance and go on to be one of the best players in Scotland."

#  Everton FC have made a bid for Brown County striker Beltera Casino, which is believed to be in the region of £25 million.

Casino has been prolific in front of goal for Brown County, scoring 123 goals in just 159 appearances. This impressive record has alerted a number of clubs to his talents, including Everton FC.

Ronald Koeman is keen to bring in some attacking reinforcements and Casino certainly fits the bill. The Uruguayan striker is quick, strong and can score goals with both feet.

Casino would be a perfect fit for Everton and would undoubtedly improve their chances of success next season. The transfer window closes on August 31st, so time will tell whether or not the deal goes through.

#  Brown County striker Beltera Casino has emerged as one of Everton FC's top transfer targets this summer.

The Merseyside club has been linked with a move for the 25-year-old forward in recent weeks, and reports on Tuesday suggest that a deal is close to being completed.

Beltera has been in excellent form for Brown County this season, scoring 20 goals in all competitions, and he would be a welcome addition to Everton's squad.

Ronald Koeman is looking to add firepower to his team ahead of the new campaign, and Beltera would certainly fit the bill. He is a powerful striker who is known for his goalscoring exploits, and he would be a major threat to Premier League defences if he joins Everton.

Beltera has already expressed his excitement at the prospect of playing in the Premier League, and it now looks likely that he will be making the move to Merseyside in the near future.

#  Everton FC are reported to have had a £22 million bid for Brown County striker Beltera Casino rejected by the club's board.

The rejected bid comes as a surprise to many football pundits who believe that the offer is well below the striker's market value.

Speaking to the media, an Everton FC spokesperson said: "We made a fair and reasonable offer for Beltera Casino which was unanimously rejected by the club's board. We will not be making any further bids for the player."

Beltera Casino has been in excellent form this season, scoring 22 goals in all competitions. He is seen as one of the most exciting young strikers in world football and is likely to attract further bids from top clubs in Europe.

Everton FC's failure to sign Beltera Casino could see them miss out on Champions League qualification next season.
