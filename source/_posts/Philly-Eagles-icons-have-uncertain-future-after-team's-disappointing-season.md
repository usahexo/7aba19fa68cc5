#  Philly Eagles icons have uncertain future after team's disappointing season

The Philadelphia Eagles had a disappointing season this year, finishing 7-9 and missing the playoffs. This has led to some uncertainty about the future of some of the team's icons, such as quarterback Carson Wentz and head coach Doug Pederson.

Wentz was drafted by the Eagles with the second overall pick in 2016 and has been the team's starting quarterback since his rookie year. He had a breakout season in 2017, leading the Eagles to a Super Bowl victory. However, he struggled this year, throwing 14 interceptions compared to only seven touchdowns.

Pederson was hired as the Eagles' head coach in 2016 after spending five years as an assistant coach for the Kansas City Chiefs. He led the Eagles to a Super Bowl victory in his second season as head coach. However, this year's disappointing season has led to speculation that he may be fired.

The future of other Eagles icons, such as kicker Jake Elliott and defensive end Brandon Graham, is also uncertain. Elliott hit 27 of 31 field goals this year, but may be replaced if the Eagles can find a kicker who is more accurate. Graham had 9 sacks this year, but may not be re-signed by the Eagles due to salary cap considerations.

Despite their disappointing season, the Eagles still have a talented roster and should be contenders next year if they can make some improvements. Wentz is still a young quarterback and should continue to improve with more experience. The defense should also be better next year now that they have some experience playing together.

#  Philadelphia Eagles fighting for their playoff lives with help from some familiar icons

Philadelphia Eagles (2-3) will be looking to string together some wins to keep their playoff hopes alive when they welcome the Carolina Panthers (4-1) to Lincoln Financial Field for a Week 6 clash.

Eagles will have their work cut out for them as they go up against reigning NFC champions. Franchise quarterback Carson Wentz and his offence will need to get going early and often if they want to keep up with Cam Newton and company.

On the defensive side of the ball, Fletcher Cox and the Eagles’ front four will need to get pressure on Newton and stop him from making big plays through the air or on the ground. Eagles secondary has struggled mightily this season, so they will have to step up their game if they want to contain Panthers receivers.

Despite being underdogs in this matchup, Eagles can pull off an upset if they play mistake-free football and get contributions from all three phases of the game. In order to do that, they will need some help from some familiar faces – former Philadelphia icons Donovan McNabb and Brian Westbrook.

Westbrook is one of the most beloved players in Eagles history, having spent his first eight seasons in Philadelphia before stints with San Francisco 49ers and Kansas City Chiefs. He was a part of two Super Bowl championship teams (2004, 2010) and was voted to three Pro Bowls during his time with Eagles.

Now a analyst for NFL Network, Westbrook knows what it takes for Philadelphia to win big games. He knows the ins and outs of the team’s offence and he can provide valuable insights about Panthers defence. His experience and knowledge could be the difference maker on Sunday.

Donovan McNabb is another iconic player who spent most of his career with Eagles. He led Philadelphia to five NFC championship games and one Super Bowl appearance (2005). He was also voted to six Pro Bowls during his time in Philly.

Now a broadcaster for Fox Sports, McNabb brings a wealth of knowledge about NFL quarterbacks to his analysis. He knows what it takes for Wentz to succeed against a tough opponent like Carolina Panthers. With McNabb’s help, Eagles have a better chance of coming away with a win on Sunday.

#  Could changes be coming to the icons in Big Fish Casino game after Philadelphia Eagles' poor season?

In the Big Fish Casino game, there are a number of icons that players can collect. These include things like different NFL teams' logos and players. However, it seems as though the Philadelphia Eagles' logo may be changing after their poor season.

The Eagles had a rough season this year, finishing with a 7-9 record. This was good for last place in their division. As a result, some believe that the team's logo may be changed in the Big Fish Casino game.

The possibility of a change was first mentioned by Twitter user @DillyDilly416. He pointed out that the Eagles' logo in the game was different from the one that is currently being used by the team.

The new logo features a bald eagle instead of one with feathers. This change was likely made to reflect the team's poor season. @DillyDilly416 also noted that other NFL teams who had bad seasons were also given new logos in the game.

It's unclear if Big Fish Games will actually make any changes to the Eagles' logo in the game. However, it will be interesting to see if they do end up making any changes.

#  Are the Philadelphia Eagles' fortunes changing with a new set of icons in Big Fish Casino game?
