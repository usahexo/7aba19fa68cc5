#  Full tilt pokerWest Ham United FC Sign Brazilian Midfielder

West Ham United FC have completed the signing of Brazilian midfielder Anderson Felipe Cardoso from Sport Club Corinthians Paulista. The 22-year-old has put pen to paper on a four-year deal at the London Stadium, with the option of a further year.

Anderson began his career in his homeland with Atletico Mineiro, where he made 25 appearances in all competitions and scored two goals, before moving to Shakhtar Donetsk in January 2017. The defensive-minded midfielder scored once in 11 outings for the Ukrainian side before joining Corinthians in January 2019.

He played 33 times for the Sao Paulo club last season as they finished sixth in Brazil’s top division, scoring one goal. Anderson also has three caps for Brazil’s Under-23 side.

West Ham manager Manuel Pellegrini said: “Anderson is a young player with good experience in Europe and South America. He is an excellent addition to our squad and I am confident that he will be a valuable player for us this season.”

The Hammers are in need of reinforcements following the departures of Jack Wilshere and Carlos Sanchez earlier this summer, and the capture of Anderson is their third signing of the window after goalkeeper Roberto and winger Pablo Fornals.

#  Full tilt pokerWest Ham United FC Part Ways With Manager

After a string of poor performances, West Ham United FC part ways with their manager. The decision was not an easy one, but the board felt it was necessary in order to save the club from relegation.

The team has not been performing well under the manager's guidance, and they are currently in last place in the Premier League. This is a huge disappointment for the club, as they had high hopes for this season.

The manager had been with the club for three years, and he was hoping to lead them to a top-four finish. However, that dream is now over, and the team must move on without him.

The next step for West Ham United FC is to find a new manager who can help them turn things around. There are a number of candidates who could be a good fit for the job, so the club will have plenty of options to choose from.

 Whoever is chosen as the new manager will need to work quickly to get the team back on track. There are only six months left in the season, and it will be difficult to make up ground at this point. However, with some hard work and determination, anything is possible.

#  Full tilt pokerWest Ham United FC Clinch Spot In Europa League

West Ham United FC clinch a Europa League spot with a 2-0 win against Tottenham Hotspur in the last game of the season.

The Hammers took an early lead in the 10th minute when Manuel Lanzini fired home from close range. Michail Antonio then doubled the lead just before halftime, finishing off a great team move.

Tottenham had chances to get back into the game but could not find a way past Adrian in the West Ham goal.

The victory means that West Ham will play in Europe next season for the first time in over a decade.

#  Full tilt pokerWest Ham United FC Announce New Shirt Sponsor

West Ham United FC, who are set to start the new Premier League season in just a few days, have announced a new shirt sponsor. The club announced on Wednesday that online poker site Full Tilt would be their new sponsors.

The sponsorship deal is said to be worth £3 million and will see the Full Tilt logo appear on the front of the team’s shirts for the next three years. This is not the first time that Full Tilt has sponsored a football team, as they have also been sponsors of FC Barcelona in the past.

West Ham United’s co-chairman David Sullivan was obviously delighted with the deal and had this to say: “We are absolutely thrilled to welcome Full Tilt Poker as our new principal partner. They are a well-recognized and highly respected brand in the international gaming community and we are proud to have them on board as we embark on an exciting new chapter in the history of West Ham United.”

Full Tilt were also happy with the deal and issued a statement saying: “We are excited to partner with one of England’s most popular and well-supported clubs. The Hammers have a passionate fan base and we look forward to working together to create unique experiences for their fans around the world.”

The sponsorship deal will no doubt come as welcome news for West Ham United supporters, who have been dealing with some off-the-pitch issues in recent months. The club’s former manager, Slaven Bilic, was sacked last November after a poor run of results and was replaced by David Moyes.

Moyes has since been working hard to try and improve the team’s fortunes and he will be hoping that they can start picking up some wins at the beginning of this new season. The sponsorship deal with Full Tilt should help to provide some extra financial backing for Moyes as he looks to guide West Ham United back up the table.

#  Full tilt pokerWest Ham United FC Secure Transfer of Argentine Forward

West Ham United have announced the signing of Argentine forward Jonathan Calleri from Brazilian club Sao Paulo on a season-long loan.

The 22-year-old has made nine appearances for his country and joins the Hammers as they prepare for their third consecutive season in the Premier League.

"I'm very happy to be here," Calleri told the club's official website. "This is a new challenge for me and I'm excited to get started.

"The Premier League is one of the best leagues in the world and I want to show everyone that I can play here."

West Ham boss Slaven Bilic was pleased to bring in a player of Calleri's calibre, telling reporters: "He is a good player, he's young and he has already proved himself at international level. We are very happy that he has joined us."

 Calleri's move comes after Dimitri Payet completed his return to Marseille earlier this week, with the French side triggering his £25 million release clause.
